                         <p>
                              Hey there, I'm <span class="accent">Freed</span>. <br>
                              I'm a 15-year-old <span style="color: rgb(255,0,128);">bi</span><span style="color: rgb(163,73,164);">sex</span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);">ual</span> human who is a bit to nerdy with computers. <br>
                              And with nerdy I mean that this whole site is build around it. <br>
                              Also I'm very tall. Okay maybe not as tall as most Dutch people but I'm tall enough. <br>
                              My pronouns are he/they. <br>
                              <br>
                              I am also a fan of FOSS and the GNU/Linux family of operating systems. (I use Arch btw.) <br> 
                              And not to forget, I like to program, although most of what I do right now is infrastructure. <br>
                              Most of my (programming) projects involve IoT or Technology, although I don't mind to try something different. <br>
                              Talking about programming, these are the programming languages I know: <br>

                         <p>
                              The year of <span class="accent">Linux</span>. <br>
                              In January of 2022 I installed Zorin OS on my PC and decided to daily drive it. <br>
                              After about 2 weeks, I wasn't interested in Zorin OS anymore. <br>
                              So I started distro hopping. <br>
                              Eventually in June 2022 I started using Arch Linux which I'm still using to this day. <br>
                              I was also very busy setting up my first virtualization servers back in december. <br>
                         </p>

                         <h3>2021</h3>
                         <p>
                              The year of <span class="accent">Raspberry Pi.</span> <br>
                              In January 2021 I kinda destroyed my previous Raspberry Pi so I bought a new one. <br>
                              I used this Raspberry pi as my only server for lots of projects. <br>
                              I hosted everything from Minecraft servers all the way to websites and even made it into a NAS. <br>
                              And it's still running to this day, acting as my portable router. <br>
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              The year of <span class="accent">exploring</span>. <br>
                              In this year I started making a lot of Minecraft servers.  <br>
                              Thanks to this I learned about port forwarding and a bit about infrastructure. <br>
                              I also bought my first Arduino in this year, which I liked to tinker with. <br>
                              And not to forget, I tried to make this exact website, which back then failed. <br>
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              The year of <span class="accent">portable operating systems</span>. <br>
                              2019 was the year where it kinda all began. <br>
                              Sure, I did a lot with computers before 2019, but I never started any serious projects. <br>
                              In 2019 I started experimenting with booting different operating systems from portable media. <br>
                              Following that, I bought my first Raspberry Pi! <br>
                              That is also one of the first encounters I had with Linux. <br>
