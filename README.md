# Freeddev
A project that started as a concept but turned into my little corner of the internet.
This here is my website, a piece of the internet, fully controlled by me.
Don't worry tho, it's just full of information about me and who I am. Nothing more, nothing less.
I won't try to hack your computer through here. (Atleast not yet ;))
Not like I have the skills to do that anyway.

## History
Freeddev started as an open-source website back in 2021, tho not a lot of effort was put into the design of the website. 
That changed with Freeddev version 1.0, this was the first version to be put on Github and to be released as a website which you can visit.
The early versions of Freeddev were basic in design and didn't really feature anything. It was just a way for my 13 year old self to show what I was able to do.
However that changed with version 1.0 as I actually had motivation to make my own website. 
Not only that but I also had an exam comming up which required me to write a website. 
Version 1.x has been sunsetted as of 2th of June 2023, and will no longer be updated or worked upon by myself.
